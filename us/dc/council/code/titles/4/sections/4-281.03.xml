    <text>The Department may establish preference criteria and an application process, and may also conduct a randomized lottery to select eligible households to participate in the program and to aid in the evaluation of the program. Preference criteria may factor in whether a household is participating in a time-limited housing-assistance program, includes children under the age of 18, and is willing to participate in career-related and other program activities. Preference criteria may limit participation to households that are participating in one or more specific housing-assistance programs at the time their initial eligibility for the program is determined.</text>
