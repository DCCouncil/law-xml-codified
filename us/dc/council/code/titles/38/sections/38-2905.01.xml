    <text>In addition to the grade level and supplemental allocations provided pursuant to §§ <cite path="§38-2904">38-2904</cite> and <cite path="§38-2905">38-2905</cite>, additional allocations shall be provided on the basis of the count of students identified as at-risk.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(b)</num>
    <text>The additional allocations required by subsection (a) of this section shall be calculated by applying weighting factors, as reflected in <cite path="38|29|I">this subchapter</cite>, to the foundation level.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(c)</num>
    <text>The weighting factors for at-risk students shall be applied cumulatively in the counts of students who fall into more than one of the formula weighting categories; provided, that for students identified as both at-risk and as participating in an alternative program or as adult learners, only the alternative program weighting shall apply.</text>
  </para>
  <para>
    <num>(c-1)</num>
    <text>To ensure alignment between the alternative program and at-risk weighting factors, the alternative program weighting factor should be amended whenever the grades 9-12, at-risk, or at-risk high school over-age supplement weighting factors are amended.</text>

      <text>Only schools that have at-risk student populations greater than 40% of the school's total population may receive funding from the at-risk &gt; 40% concentration supplement.  The number of students for which a school may receive the per pupil allocation for the at-risk &gt; 40% concentration supplement shall be equal to the number of at-risk students enrolled in the school minus the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of 40% times that school's total student population.</text>
