    <text>If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before April 20, 2024 and the action would have resulted in perfection of the security interest had the security interest become enforceable before April 20, 2024, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under the 2024 Act before the adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under the 2024 Act before the adjustment date.</text>
