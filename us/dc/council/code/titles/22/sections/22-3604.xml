    <text>Any person who commits a crime of violence, as that term is defined in <cite path="§23-1331|(4)">§ 23-1331(4)</cite>, against a vulnerable adult may be punished by a fine of up to 1 1/2 times the maximum fine otherwise authorized for the offense and may be imprisoned for a term of up to 1 1/2 times the maximum term of imprisonment otherwise authorized for the offense, or both.</text>

    <text>It is an affirmative defense that the accused knew or reasonably believed that the victim was not a vulnerable adult at the time of the offense, or could not have known or determined that the victim was a vulnerable adult because of the manner in which the offense was committed. This defense shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
